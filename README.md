csv data for the the main reference chart in the Counterexamples in Topology book (page 194 - 203)

## Description
This is a digitized version of the main reference chart in Steen and Seebach (1978), for ease of comparison of different topological properties. For simplicity, both empty entry ('unknown') and dashed entry ('can be both yes and no') are coded as NA in the csv file.
